# Privacy Policy for the “pocket_piggy” extension

This extension was created as a virtual Tamagotchi game.

## Data collection and use
* **Personal data**: The extension does not collect, store, or transmit any personal data about users (such as names, email addresses, locations, etc.).
* **Local storage**: All game data (piggy name, hunger levels, happiness, and other metrics) is stored exclusively in your browser's local storage using `chrome.storage.local`.
* **Transfer to third parties**: We do not transfer any data to third parties, as we do not have access to your game data.

## Permissions
The extension requests `storage` permission solely to ensure that game progress is saved between sessions.
